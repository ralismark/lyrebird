      [00:36.09] 🐐Bird cage blue and yellow
      [00:38.91] 🐐Candles warm and windows bare
      [00:44.30] 🐐Tracing upturned smiles of portraits
      [00:48.52] 🐐Drawn to disappear
      [00:52.79] 🐐Flowers never talk
      [00:55.56] 🐐They never want, they never need
      [01:00.83] 🐐In a cradle gilded
      [01:03.54] 🐐They are left to rot yet never bleed
      [01:09.96] 🐐Eyes of silver, mirror, mirror
      [01:14.01] 🐐Thread on wood and steel
      [01:18.41] 🐐Keep what can be kept
      [01:21.04] 🐐And heave to see which one will kneel
      [01:26.90] 🐐I've been told to wait
      [01:29.55] 🐐But why should there be silence
      [01:32.13] 🐐Dawning pretty laces
      [01:34.18] 🐐Weaving capеs of gold
      [01:36.92] 🐐And framing muffled faces
      [01:39.54] 🐐I can be diffеrent
      [01:42.02] 🐐I can't be puppeted
      [01:43.93] 🐐Garden evergreen
      [01:46.42] 🐐Was what I thought what I would see
      [01:52.44] 🐐Branches meet my steps
      [01:54.99] 🐐Their kisses open up ravines
      [02:00.81] 🐐Fences frozen in a dance
      [02:05.18] 🐐They've yet to perform
      [02:08.88] 🐐I leave the house and the Baroness
      [02:13.66] 🐐Buried in before
      [02:18.25] 🐐Finndu mig í framtíðinni (tr: Find me in the future)
