      [00:36.09] 🐐Bird cage blue and yellow
      [00:38.91] 🐐Candles warm and windows bare
      [00:44.30] 🐐Tracing upturned smiles of portraits
      [00:48.52] 🐐Drawn to disappear
      [00:52.79] 🐐Flowers never talk
      [00:55.56] 🐐They never want, they never need
      [01:00.83] 🐐In a cradle gilded
      [01:03.54] 🐐They are left to rot yet never bleed
      [01:09.96] 🐐Eyes of silver, mirror, mirror
      [01:14.01] 🐐Thread on wood and steel
      [01:18.41] 🐐Keep what can be kept
      [01:21.04] 🐐And heave to see which one will kneel
      [01:26.90] 🐐I've been told to wait
      [01:29.55] 🐐But why should there be silence
      [01:32.13] 🐐Dawning pretty laces
      [01:34.18] 🐐Weaving capеs of gold
      [01:36.92] 🐐And framing muffled faces
      [01:39.54] 🐐I can be diffеrent
      [01:42.02] 🐐I can't be puppeted
      [01:43.93] 🐐Garden evergreen
      [01:46.42] 🐐Was what I thought what I would see
      [01:52.44] 🐐Branches meet my steps
      [01:54.99] 🐐Their kisses open up ravines
      [02:00.81] 🐐Fences frozen in a dance
      [02:05.18] 🐐They've yet to perform
      [02:08.88] 🐐I leave the house and the Baroness
      [02:13.66] 🐐Buried in before
      [02:18.25] 🐐Finndu mig í framtíðinni --- Find me in the future
      [02:20.30] 🫎🪵Malayang maya, malayo-layo --- Free sparrow, far away

      [00:15.40] 🫎Must I look below mildewy timbers?
      [00:31.15] 🫎Staves my feet are perched on
      [00:45.87] 🫎Able to bear my weight with no protest
      [00:53.85] 🫎And yet I am to tumble down
      [01:02.69] 🫎(Dare me to flood what is already drowning)
      [01:05.37] 🫎(Shoot him whose heart you can already see)
      [01:07.70] 🫎(She who refuses to peek through the curtains)
      [01:10.01] 🫎(The children are angry as they should be)
      [01:12.58] 🫎Down to where I can hear them
      [01:17.81] 🫎"Glory thy stillness"
      [01:24.73] 🫎Was a verse mistaken
      [01:33.26] 🫎By disfavored ones like you
      [01:41.90] 🫎Oh-ha-oh-ha-ha
      [01:45.33] 🫎Oh-ha-oh-ha-ha
      [01:48.82] 🫎To douse a scalded tongue
      [01:52.46] 🫎Incanted herd and flock!
      [01:56.33] 🫎In places the lark haven't carolled heretofore
      [02:04.41] 🫎From faults, favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:08.11] 🫎From faults, favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:12.08] 🫎From faults, favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:15.86] 🫎That love alone-
      [02:17.07] 🫎Love alone isn't enough!
      [02:19.95] 🫎From faults, favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:23.78] 🫎From faults, favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:27.66] 🫎From faults, favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:31.42] 🫎That love alone-
      [02:32.77] 🫎Love alone isn't enough!
