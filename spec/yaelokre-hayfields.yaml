      [00:53.97] 🐰I can hear the song of the hartebeest
      [01:02.40] 🐰As their hooves drum to a hunger
      [01:10.88] 🐰I can sing a fear or a malady
      [01:19.06] 🐰As I drown deep in the wonder
      [01:27.29] 🐰Where do we go
      [01:31.24] 🐰When the river's running slow
      [01:35.63] 🐰Where do we run

      [02:29.50] 🐰Enough for the hunt to go awry
      [02:38.27] 🐰Where do we go
      [02:41.91] 🐰When the river's running slow
      [02:46.67] 🐰Where do we run
      [02:50.34] 🐰When the acres turn green and the cats kill one by one

      [00:04.49] 🐰Grazing pelts we all once wore
      [00:07.96] 🐰A kindling of a swordless bloodshed

      [00:57.22] 🐰Deeper into corpses rotting
      [01:00.43] 🐰But they can't hear you talk, talk, talk
      [01:03.34] 🐰About every little thing
