        [00:00.18] 🐰This is a story about two children
        [00:09.28] 🐰One who hid to be heard,
        [00:13.05] 🐐And another who ran to be remembered!
        [00:15.59] 🐰🐐I present to you, "Kid & Leveret"
        [00:18.73] 🐰Ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah, ooh-woah! (🐐La-la-la-la-la-la-la~)
        [00:22.37] 🐰Ooh, woah, oh-oh, oh! (🐐La-la-la-la-la-la-la~)
        [00:28.56] 🐰Found in forgotten fields of flaxen,
        [00:32.25] 🐰I was the leveret in hiding.
        [00:36.23] 🐰Rowdy and rigorous they reave and rally,
        [00:40.05] 🐰There, where the houses once stood
        [00:43.24] 🐰It used to be a kingdom, for a foolish majesty.
        [00:47.40] 🐰Then he put his hands over his ears, and welcomed entropy.
        [00:51.16] 🐰Camе the undergrowth, overburdеning before
        [00:55.27] 🐰What is left is a hamlet, and the wails of yore!
        [00:59.61] 🐰Found in forgotten fields of flaxen,
        [01:03.48] 🐰I was the leveret in hiding!
        [01:07.56] 🐰Rowdy and rigorous they reave and rally,
        [01:11.22] 🐰There, where the houses once stood...!
        [01:15.13] 🐰Bam, bam, bam! Down the door and here I am!
        [01:18.31] 🐰Beyond the cranny, "Come hither," says the feathered lady!
        [01:22.97] 🐰"Fare thee well to the hound that held your home"
        [01:26.49] 🐰Foreboding, farther off we'll go
        [01:30.79] 🐰Found in forgotten fields of flaxen! (🐐Forgotten fields of flaxen!)
        [01:34.69] 🐰I was the leveret in hiding! (🐐He was the leveret in hiding!)
        [01:38.62] 🐰Rowdy and rigorous they reave and rally, (🐐Rowdy and rigorous they reave and rally,)

        [01:54.65] 🐰Ah-oh, ah-oh, ah-oh! (🐐Oh-oh, oh-oh!)
        [02:04.64] 🐐Her father was a doll maker,
        [02:08.00] 🐐He taught her how to weave one's movement
        [02:13.29] 🐐The marionette who took the thread,
        [02:17.02] 🐐When the baron lost his head, oh!
        [02:21.19] 🐐A spider, a spinner, believe her, she's a mother!
        [02:29.05] 🐐A woe of many morns, amidst a storm!
        [02:33.32] 🐐She receives a knock on the door... (Knock, knock, knock!)
        [02:38.91] 🐐A sight of silver and locks of gold!
        [02:42.62] 🐐Kid among beast of metal and malice!
        [02:46.69] 🐐I was real and she was alone, (🐰She was alone,)
        [02:50.57] 🐐Bird among bears of bark and leaves!! (🐰Bird among bears of bark and leaves!!)

      [00:00.61] (🐰It doesn't matter, though, does it?)
      [00:19.68] 🐰It starts off slow, though you can't keep up
      [00:23.25] 🐰Feel your feet sink to the ground
      [00:28.11] 🐰It wants you here and it won't let go
      [00:31.53] 🐰Pull you deeper and deeper until you can't be found
      [00:36.41] 🐰Where do I want to be?
      [00:39.97] 🐰Either way, you'll be there with me
      [00:44.09] 🐰I don't think that I could see
      [00:48.09] 🐰Oh! The seeds are growing inside
      [00:51.89] 🐰They want to be free
      [00:55.32] 🐰Hmm-mm, mm-mm
      [01:01.43] 🐰If I crawl out, it leaves you hollow
      [01:05.68] 🐰I carry nothing, but the breath I borrow
      [01:09.75] 🐰Let it hurt, it won't end until you say it should
      [01:16.24] (🐐It's never up to me, silly!)
      [01:17.90] 🐰Pluck my eyes, cut my hair
      [01:22.29] 🐰Break my teeth until it's fair
      [01:26.32] 🐰Let it bleed, let it dry
      [01:30.68] 🐰Let it be (🐐let it be)
      [01:34.65] 🐰It won't get easier
      [01:36.92] 🐰If that's what I think
      [01:38.61] 🐰Slow as the gravel rumble beneath the leathers
      [01:41.22] 🐰Tearing what it could cling to
      [01:43.89] 🐰Scatter, scatter they
      [01:50.37] 🐰They do

      [00:15.40] 🫎Must I look below
      [00:22.50] 🫎Mildewy timbers? (Ooh)
      [00:31.15] 🫎Staves my feet
      [00:38.43] 🫎Are perched on (Ooh)
      [00:45.87] 🫎Able to bear my weight with no protest
      [00:53.85] 🫎And yet I am
      [01:01.27] 🫎To tumble down
      [01:02.69] 🫎Dare me to flood what is already drowning
      [01:05.37] 🫎Shoot him whose heart you can already see
      [01:07.70] 🫎She who refuses to peek through the curtains
      [01:10.01] 🫎The children are angry as they should be (Down to)
      [01:12.58] 🫎Where I can hear them
      [01:17.81] 🫎"Glory thy stillness"
      [01:24.73] 🫎Was a verse mistaken
      [01:33.26] 🫎By disfavored ones
      [01:40.56] 🫎Like you
      [01:41.90] 🫎Oh-ha-oh-ha-ha
      [01:45.33] 🫎Oh-ha-oh-ha-ha
      [01:48.82] 🫎To douse a scalded tongue
      [01:52.46] 🫎Incanted herd and flock!
      [01:56.33] 🫎In places the lark haven't carolled heretofore
      [02:04.41] 🫎From faults, to favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:08.11] 🫎From faults, to favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:12.08] 🫎From faults, to favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:15.86] 🫎That love alone-
      [02:17.07] 🫎Love alone isn't enough!
      [02:19.95] 🫎From faults, to favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:23.78] 🫎From faults, to favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:27.66] 🫎From faults, to favors, failures and the truth!
      [02:31.42] 🫎That love alone-
      [02:32.77] 🫎Love alone isn't enough!
      [02:43.00]
